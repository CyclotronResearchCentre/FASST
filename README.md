This Git/SVN open repository allows us to distribute FASST public version more regularly with bug fixes and the latest features. And end-users can directly update their version by synchronizing with this repository.
A Wiki is also available (though empty at the moment) and problems/bugs can be officially notified through the "Issues" interface.

#### Notes:
* On *March 2, 2016*, FASST is at last compatible with SPM12!
Appologies for the delay, code was used internally but never updated on the public repository...
* The artefact detection tool, published in here http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027015003994, is NOT ready yet to be used by the public. We are working on the remaining issues and hope to make the code available ASAP.
